## Description

These are my dotfiles for multiple apps. Currently working on an isntall script as well.

* * *

## App

* Kitty
* Ranger
* Neovim
* neofetch
* zathura
* zshrc

* * *

## To Add:

* [ ] git dotfiles
* [ ] VSCode/Codium
* [ ] spicetify
* [ ] Document ZSH setup installs
  * [ ] theme
  * [ ] plugins with antigen
  * [ ] nvm
  * [ ] chruby

## WIP

Current state of setup script:
It does recognize what OS you are running and is able to install repositories for signal and spotify, update apt repositories, auto install brew, and auto install apt applications.

- Install for linux no longer involves Homebrew
- dotfiles repo alias fails to properly load
- Need to look into creating a github gist or bitbucket snippet to potentially resolve the alias error
